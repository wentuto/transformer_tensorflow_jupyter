# transformer_tensorflow_jupyter
Jupyter code to train English-to-Chinese translation transformer model and evaluate it by tensorflow framework.
Original code comes from https://leemeng.tw/neural-machine-translation-with-transformer-and-tensorflow2.html
But I modified it for running @ Tensorflow 2.13 

# Library

TF Version: 2.13
cuDNN Version: 8.6

# For docker user to build environment
```
docker compose build transformer
./start_trans.sh
```
